# Advent of code 2021

My run for [2021's Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/2021) :)  


I'll be doing this first run in Python. Maybe I'll try Go or Kotlin later to learn the languages.  
Tests are only being added when necessary to debug faulty solutions.

### Instructions
Inputs should be saved to `inputs/input_0X.txt`. One file per puzzle.  
Installing depedencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.  
Executing the code: `python -m advent.puzzle_01`.
